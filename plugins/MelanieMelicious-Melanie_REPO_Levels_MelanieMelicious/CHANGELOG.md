## 0.1.1
- Added 2 minor rooms to tiles (mod updates are small since my mind is elsewhere at the moment).
- Added colliders previously missing on some bottom-level ceilings to try fix enemies shooting players through floors.
- Fixed tile registry issues (as far as stopping warnings in logs) for multiplayer lobbies. Hopefully fixed level desync and missing tiles.
- Changed and moved some item spawns.

## 0.1.0
- Rebalanced plank cross sections (readjusted positions, widened planks, transitioned most single planks to dual, added some "catch" sections and platform rests, and overall made more forgiving).
- Added a little more decor (still planned to add more, wanted to upload fixes).
- You can play with chairs now.
- Removed collision trapping extraction teleport for bugged heads and players.

## 0.0.1

- Fixed some map walls being incorrect.
- Hid roof section inside extraction tube.

## 0.0.0
- Initial release.
